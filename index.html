        <p>December evening. Frost gathering on the inside of the skylight, the room held in a quiet breath.</p>
        
        <p>I have started this letter more times than I care to count. Each attempt lost its way before the kettle finished boiling. Tonight I let the water cool and began again. I wanted the sentences to be light enough to hold without effort.</p>
        
        <p>You are home now, or near enough that the word fits again. I picture you unpacking slower than you intended, finding familiar things in unfamiliar places, relearning the arrangement of drawers. I hope the street outside smells faintly of pine. I hope the life around you feels like softness returning, not noise.</p>
        <p> Somewhere between new lectures, unfamiliar hallways, and nights when the radiator argued with itself, you learned the outline of a town that did not resemble your childhood map. I think of you walking home from late labs, rain starting, headphones in without music, letting that hush teach you its own language. Somewhere in that quiet you decided certain doors could stay locked for a while, and that silence toward an old friend might be shelter rather than distance. </p>
        
        <p>I imagine you pushing open the heavy door after the long ride home, your suitcase rumbling behind you as three small storms sprint down the hallway to collide with your knees. I see you kneel and let them claim you, your laugh unguarded for the first time in months. Their fur will smell like the cupboard they adopted, the blanket you left folded now ruled as territory. I hope you stay there on the floor until their hum settles, until the house remembers your breathing.</p>
        
        <p>On my side the year folded in on itself. Career questions, my father's strain, my mother's tears. All of that kinda just was something that reshapes you one small fracture at a time. Nothing dramatic maybe but perhaps, just plans rubbed thin by reality. I've been better though, I remind myself that paper can be turned over. Pencils forgive more than pride does.</p>
        
        <p>I think often of the long exchange we had last summer, how we left every door open and still managed to stand in the same room. I reread it the other night. Your sentences still felt like hands I could hold without hesitation. That part has stayed unchanged.</p>
        
        <p>Since then the months grew crowded. You learned a new city. I learned how to move through a difficult season. Some days we forgot to answer each other's questions. I never took it personally. You were surviving your world, and I was surviving mine. The thread loosened because tugging would have hurt someone. That felt like care, not absence. I never read the quiet as refusal. Only as two people swimming in different waters for a while.</p>
        
        <p>But I need to say this plainly. There were evenings when my own unease made me reach for my phone too quickly, when I mistook your quiet for distance rather than for rest. If any of those messages arrived with edges, I am sorry. I was trying to steady myself and used your name as ballast more than once. It was never your job to hold my balance; that responsibility is mine alone. I offer this not to ask for forgiveness, only to place the small rough stone back in my own pocket where it belongs.</p>
        
        <p>Tonight the streetlights blink across the window and the dishes are finally done. In this ordinary moment I find I still want you to know one simple thing. My affection for you did not shrink when the messages slowed. It did not wobble or search for reassurance. It settled into a chair and waited with its hands folded. I do not need it returned today or any day. It exists whether or not you look in its direction. That is the whole truth. Everything beyond that is ornament.</p>
        
        <p>I want to place a gentle hand on all of this before I sleep. The lamp I keep for you is still low-watt and always optional. If you ever feel like talking about the cats, about college, about nothing heavy at all, I am here at a steady volume. And if reaching out feels awkward or uncertain, you can begin with cheatcode, "hey hows the weather there?"</p>
        
        <p>If not, the light stays on anyway. A small star that minds its own business.</p>
        
        <p>Until then, or longer, I will picture you on the carpet, laughter caught between paws, the room exhaling because you are home.</p>
        
        <p>With gratitude,</p>
